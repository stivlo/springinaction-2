= Spring in Action, Second Edition =

The source code from the book about the Spring Framework version 2, by Craig Walls, with my own additions and tests.
Original source code can be found at http://www.manning.com/walls3/ -- Here there are actually more self contained
examples than in the original source code, since I'd like to really understand how this stuff works, even if it slow
down a lot my reading pace.  Dependencies are downloaded with Maven. 

To run the examples:

<pre style="color:blue">
$ mvn compile

$ scripts/ch01-hello-HelloApp                     # Injecting properties
$ scripts/ch01-knight-KnightApp                   # Injecting beans
$ scripts/ch01-mistrel-KnightWithMinstrelApp      # The Knight has to call the minstrel
$ scripts/ch01-mistrel-KnightAndMinstrelApp       # Aspect oriented programming

$ scripts/ch02-springidol-DukeApp                 # Simple Bean Creation
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-Duke15App               # Bean Creation with constructor args
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-PoeticJugglerApp        # Bean Creation with constructor refs
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-KennyApp                # Bean Creation with setter injection
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-KennyPianoApp           # Same Bean playing a different instrument
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-KennySharingWithDukeApp # Showing that there is only one Saxophone
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-TwoSaxophonesApp        # With inner beans Duke and Kenny have a private Saxophone
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-HankApp                 # Hank, one man band, showing collection wiring
