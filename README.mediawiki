= Spring in Action, Second Edition =

The source code from the book about the Spring Framework version 2, by Craig Walls, with my own additions and tests. Dependencies are downloaded with Maven. I've just started on 7 July 2011.

To run the examples:

<pre style="color:blue">
$ mvn compile

$ scripts/ch01-hello-HelloApp                  #Injecting properties
$ scripts/ch01-knight-KnightApp                #Injecting beans
$ scripts/ch01-mistrel-KnightWithMinstrelApp   #The Knight has to call the minstrel
$ scripts/ch01-mistrel-KnightAndMinstrelApp    #Aspect oriented programming
</pre>
