= Spring in Action, Second Edition =

The source code from the book about the Spring Framework version 2, by Craig Walls, with my own additions and tests.
Original source code can be found at http://www.manning.com/walls3/ -- Here there are actually more self contained
examples than in the original source code, since I'd like to really understand how this stuff works, even if it slow
down a lot my reading pace.  Dependencies are downloaded with Maven. 

To run the examples, first do a "mvn:compile"

=== Chapter 1 - Springing into action ===

<p>An overview of Dependency Injection and AOP</p>

<pre>
$ scripts/ch01-hello-HelloApp                     # Injecting properties
$ scripts/ch01-knight-KnightApp                   # Injecting beans
$ scripts/ch01-mistrel-KnightWithMinstrelApp      # The Knight has to call the minstrel
$ scripts/ch01-mistrel-KnightAndMinstrelApp       # Aspect oriented programming
</pre>

=== Chapter 2 - Basic bean wiring ===

<p>Dependency injection</p>

<pre>
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-DukeApp                 # Simple Bean Creation
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-Duke15App               # Bean Creation with constructor args
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-PoeticJugglerApp        # Bean Creation with constructor refs
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-KennyApp                # Bean Creation with setter injection
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-KennyPianoApp           # Same Bean playing a different instrument
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-KennySharingWithDukeApp # Showing that there is only one Saxophone
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-TwoSaxophonesApp        # With inner beans Duke and Kenny have a private Saxophone
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-HankApp                 # Hank, one man band, showing collection wiring
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-HankMapApp              # Hank with a Map wiring
$ scripts/ch02-springidol-HankPropertiesApp       # Hank with Properties wiring
$ scripts/ch02-autowiring-ByNameApp               # Autowiring by name
</pre>

=== Chapter 3 - Advanced bean wiring ===

<p>About some less common techniques to perform DI, skipped</p>

=== Chapter 4 - Advising beans ===

<p>Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)</p>

The following example is broken, anyway, I'm now off to read Spring Recipes, because I've read all the basics here, and the advanced topics changed quite a bit in Spring 3.0, while this book is about Spring 2.0

<pre>
$ scripts/ch04-DukeAndAudienceApp                 # Shows MethodBeforeAdvice, AfterReturningAdvice and ThrowsAdvice
</pre>
